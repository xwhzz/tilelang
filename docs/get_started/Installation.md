# Installation Guide

## Installing with pip

**Prerequisites for installation via wheel or PyPI:**

- **glibc**: 2.28 (Ubuntu 20.04 or later)
- **Python Version**: >= 3.8
- **CUDA Version**: 12.0 <= CUDA < 13

The easiest way to install tilelang is directly from PyPI using pip. To install the latest version, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install tilelang
```

Alternatively, you may choose to install tilelang using prebuilt packages available on the Release Page:

```bash
pip install tilelang-0.0.0.dev0+ubuntu.20.4.cu120-py3-none-any.whl
```

To install the latest version of tilelang from the GitHub repository, you can run the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/tile-ai/tilelang.git
```

After installing tilelang, you can verify the installation by running:

```bash
python -c "import tilelang; print(tilelang.__version__)"
```

## Building from Source

**Prerequisites for building from source:**

- **Operating System**: Linux
- **Python Version**: >= 3.8
- **CUDA Version**: >= 10.0

If you prefer Docker, please skip to the [Install Using Docker](#install-using-docker) section. This section focuses on building from source on a native Linux environment.

First, install the OS-level prerequisites on Ubuntu/Debian-based systems using the following commands:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y python3 python3-dev python3-setuptools gcc zlib1g-dev build-essential cmake libedit-dev
```

Then, clone the tilelang repository and install it using pip. The `-v` flag enables verbose output during the build process.

> **Note**: Use the `--recursive` flag to include necessary submodules. Tilelang currently depends on a customized version of TVM, which is included as a submodule. If you prefer [Building with Existing TVM Installation](#using-existing-tvm), you can skip cloning the TVM submodule (but still need other dependencies).

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tile-ai/tilelang.git
cd tilelang
pip install . -v
```

If you want to install tilelang in development mode, you can use the `-e` flag so that any changes to the Python files will be reflected immediately without reinstallation.

```bash
pip install -e . -v
```

> **Note**: changes to C++ files require rebuilding the tilelang C++ library. See [Faster Rebuild for Developers](#faster-rebuild-for-developers) below. A default `build` directory will be created if you use `pip install`, so you can also directly run `make` in the `build` directory to rebuild it as [Working from Source via PYTHONPATH](#working-from-source-via-pythonpath) suggested below.

(working-from-source-via-pythonpath)=

### Working from Source via `PYTHONPATH` (Recommended for Developers)

If you prefer to work directly from the source tree via `PYTHONPATH` instead of using pip, make sure the native extension (`libtilelang.so`) is built first:

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DUSE_CUDA=ON
make -j
```

We also recommend using `ninja` to speed up compilation:

```bash
cmake .. -DUSE_CUDA=ON -G Ninja
ninja
```

Then add the repository root to `PYTHONPATH` before importing `tilelang`, for example:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/tilelang:$PYTHONPATH
python -c "import tilelang; print(tilelang.__version__)"
```

Some useful CMake options you can toggle while configuring:
- `-DUSE_CUDA=ON|OFF` builds against NVIDIA CUDA (default ON when CUDA headers are found).
- `-DUSE_ROCM=ON` selects ROCm support when building on AMD GPUs.
- `-DNO_VERSION_LABEL=ON` disables the backend/git suffix in `tilelang.__version__`.

(using-existing-tvm)=

### Building with Customized TVM Path

If you already have a TVM codebase, use the `TVM_ROOT` environment variable to specify the location of your existing TVM repository when building tilelang:

```bash
TVM_ROOT=<your-tvm-repo> pip install . -v
```

> **Note**: This will still rebuild the TVM-related libraries (stored in `TL_LIBS`). And this method often leads to some path issues. Check `env.py` to see some environment variables which are not set properly.

## Install Using Docker

For users who prefer a containerized environment with all dependencies pre-configured, tilelang provides Docker images for different CUDA versions. This method is particularly useful for ensuring consistent environments across different systems.

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker installed on your system
- NVIDIA Docker runtime or GPU is not necessary for building tilelang, you can build on a host without GPU and use that built image on other machine.

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tile-ai/tilelang
cd tilelang
```

2. **Build Docker Image**:

Navigate to the docker directory and build the image for your desired CUDA version:

```bash
cd docker
docker build -f Dockerfile.cu120 -t tilelang-cu120 .
```

Available Dockerfiles:
- `Dockerfile.cu120` - For CUDA 12.0
- Other CUDA versions may be available in the docker directory

3. **Run Docker Container**:

Start the container with GPU access and volume mounting:

```bash
docker run -itd \
  --shm-size 32g \
  --gpus all \
  -v /home/tilelang:/home/tilelang \
  --name tilelang_b200 \
  tilelang-cu120 \
  /bin/zsh
```

**Command Parameters Explanation:**
- `--shm-size 32g`: Increases shared memory size for better performance
- `--gpus all`: Enables access to all available GPUs
- `-v /home/tilelang:/home/tilelang`: Mounts host directory to container (adjust path as needed)
- `--name tilelang_b200`: Assigns a name to the container for easy management
- `/bin/zsh`: Uses zsh as the default shell

4. **Access the Container and Verify Installation**:

```bash
docker exec -it tilelang_b200 /bin/zsh
# Inside the container:
python -c "import tilelang; print(tilelang.__version__)"
```

## Install with Nightly Version

For users who want access to the latest features and improvements before official releases, we provide nightly builds of tilelang.

```bash
pip install tilelang -f https://tile-ai.github.io/whl/nightly/cu121/
# or pip install tilelang --find-links https://tile-ai.github.io/whl/nightly/cu121/
```

> **Note:** Nightly builds contain the most recent code changes but may be less stable than official releases. They're ideal for testing new features or if you need a specific bugfix that hasn't been released yet.

## Install Configs

### Build-time environment variables
`USE_CUDA`: If to enable CUDA support, default: `ON` on Linux, set to `OFF` to build a CPU version. By default, we'll use `/usr/local/cuda` for building tilelang. Set `CUDAToolkit_ROOT` to use different cuda toolkit.

`USE_ROCM`: If to enable ROCm support, default: `OFF`. If your ROCm SDK does not located in `/opt/rocm`, set `USE_ROCM=<rocm_sdk>` to enable build ROCm against custom sdk path.

`USE_METAL`: If to enable Metal support, default: `ON` on Darwin.

`TVM_ROOT`: TVM source root to use.

`NO_VERSION_LABEL` and `NO_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION`:
When building tilelang, we'll try to embed SDK and version information into package version as below,
where local version label could look like `<sdk>.git<git_hash>`. Set `NO_VERSION_LABEL=ON` to disable this behavior.
```
$ python -mbuild -w
...
Successfully built tilelang-0.1.6.post1+cu116.git0d4a74be-cp38-abi3-linux_x86_64.whl
```

where `<sdk>={cuda,rocm,metal}`. Specifically, when `<sdk>=cuda` and `CUDA_VERSION` is provided via env,
`<sdk>=cu<cuda_major><cuda_minor>`, similar with this part in pytorch.
Set `NO_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION=ON` to disable this.

### Run-time environment variables

Please refer to the `env.py` file for a full list of supported run-time environment variables.

## Other Tips

### IDE Configs

Building tilelang locally will automatically generate a `compile_commands.json` file in `build` dir.
VSCode with clangd and [clangd extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd) should be able to index that without extra configuration.

### Compile Cache

The default path of the compile cache is `~/.tilelang/cache`. `ccache` will be automatically used if found.

### Repairing Wheels

If you plan to use your wheel in other environment,
it's recommended to use auditwheel (on Linux) or delocate (on Darwin)
to repair them.

### Faster Rebuild for Developers

`pip install` introduces extra [un]packaging and takes ~30 sec to complete,
even if no source change.

Developers who needs to recompile frequently could use:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# For first time compilation
pip install -e . -v --no-build-isolation

# Or manually compile with cmake/ninja. Remember to set PYTHONPATH properly.
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G Ninja
ninja

# Rebuild when you change the cpp code
cd build; ninja
```

When running in editable/developer mode,
you'll see logs like below:

```console
$ python -c 'import tilelang'
2025-10-14 11:11:29  [TileLang:tilelang.env:WARNING]: Loading tilelang libs from dev root: /Users/yyc/repo/tilelang/build
```
