# 👋 Welcome to Tile Language

[GitHub](https://github.com/tile-ai/tilelang)

Tile Language (tile-lang) is a concise domain-specific language designed to streamline
the development of high-performance GPU/CPU kernels (e.g., GEMM, Dequant GEMM, FlashAttention, LinearAttention).
By employing a Pythonic syntax with an underlying compiler infrastructure on top of TVM,
tile-lang allows developers to focus on productivity without sacrificing the
low-level optimizations necessary for state-of-the-art performance.
