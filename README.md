Tile Language (**tile-lang**) is a concise domain-specific language designed to streamline the development of high-performance GPU/CPU kernels (e.g., GEMM, Dequant GEMM, FlashAttention, LinearAttention). By employing a Pythonic syntax with an underlying compiler infrastructure on top of [TVM](https://tvm.apache.org/), tile-lang allows developers to focus on productivity without sacrificing the low-level optimizations necessary for state-of-the-art performance.

## Tested Devices
Although tile-lang aims to be portable across a range of Devices, it has been specifically tested and validated on the following devices: for NVIDIA GPUs, this includes the H100 (with Auto TMA/WGMMA support), A100, V100, RTX 4090, RTX 3090, and RTX A6000; for AMD GPUs, it includes the MI250 (with Auto MatrixCore support) and the MI300X (with Async Copy support).

## OP Implementation Examples
**tile-lang** provides the building blocks to implement a wide variety of operators. Some examples include:

- [Matrix Multiplication](./examples/gemm/)
- [Dequantization GEMM](./examples/dequantize_gemm/)
- [Flash Attention](./examples/flash_attention/)
- [Flash Linear Attention](./examples/linear_attention/)
- [Flash MLA Decoding](./examples/deepseek_mla/)
- [Native Sparse Attention](./examples/deepseek_nsa/)

Within the `examples` directory, you will also find additional complex kernels—such as convolutions, forward/backward passes for FlashAttention, more operators will continuously be added.

## Benchmark Summary

TileLang achieves exceptional performance across a variety of computational patterns. Comprehensive benchmark scripts and settings are available at [tilelang-benchmark](https://github.com/tile-ai/tilelang-benchmark). Below are selected results showcasing its capabilities:

## Installation
### Method 1: Install with Pip

The quickest way to get started is to install the latest release from PyPI:

```bash
pip install tilelang
```

Alternatively, you can install directly from the GitHub repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/tile-ai/tilelang
```

Or install locally:

```bash
# install required system dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-setuptools gcc libtinfo-dev zlib1g-dev build-essential cmake libedit-dev libxml2-dev

pip install -e . -v # remove -e option if you don't want to install in editable mode, -v for verbose output
```

### Method 2: Build from Source
We currently provide three ways to install **tile-lang** from source:
- [Install from Source (using your own TVM installation)](./docs/get_started/Installation.md#method-1-install-from-source-using-your-own-tvm-installation)
- [Install from Source (using the bundled TVM submodule)](./docs/get_started/Installation.md#method-2-install-from-source-using-the-bundled-tvm-submodule)
- [Install Using the Provided Script](./docs/get_started/Installation.md#method-3-install-using-the-provided-script)

### Method 3: Install with Nightly Version

For users who want access to the latest features and improvements before official releases, we provide nightly builds of **tile-lang**.

```bash
pip install tilelang -f https://tile-ai.github.io/whl/nightly/cu121/
# or pip install tilelang --find-links https://tile-ai.github.io/whl/nightly/cu121/
```

> **Note:** Nightly builds contain the most recent code changes but may be less stable than official releases. They're ideal for testing new features or if you need a specific bugfix that hasn't been released yet.

## Quick Start

In this section, you'll learn how to write and execute a straightforward GEMM (matrix multiplication) kernel using tile-lang, followed by techniques for layout optimizations, pipelining, and L2-cache–friendly swizzling.

### GEMM Example with Annotations (Layout, L2 Cache Swizzling, and Pipelining, etc.)

Below is an example that demonstrates more advanced features: layout annotation, parallelized copy, and swizzle for improved L2 cache locality. This snippet shows how to adapt your kernel to maximize performance on complex hardware.

```python
import tilelang
import tilelang.language as T

# @tilelang.jit(target="cuda")
# target currently can be "cuda" or "hip" or "cpu".
# if not specified, it will be inferred from the input tensors during compile time
@tilelang.jit
def matmul(M, N, K, block_M, block_N, block_K, dtype=T.float16, accum_dtype=T.float):

    @T.prim_func
    def matmul_relu_kernel(
            A: T.Tensor((M, K), dtype),
            B: T.Tensor((K, N), dtype),
            C: T.Tensor((M, N), dtype),
    ):
        # Initialize Kernel Context
        with T.Kernel(T.ceildiv(N, block_N), T.ceildiv(M, block_M), threads=128) as (bx, by):
            A_shared = T.alloc_shared((block_M, block_K), dtype)
            B_shared = T.alloc_shared((block_K, block_N), dtype)
            C_local = T.alloc_fragment((block_M, block_N), accum_dtype)

            # Enable rasterization for better L2 cache locality (Optional)
            # T.use_swizzle(panel_size=10, enable=True)

            # Clear local accumulation
            T.clear(C_local)

            for ko in T.Pipelined(T.ceildiv(K, block_K), num_stages=3):
                # Copy tile of A
                # This is a sugar syntax for parallelized copy
                T.copy(A[by * block_M, ko * block_K], A_shared)

                # Copy tile of B
                T.copy(B[ko * block_K, bx * block_N], B_shared)

                # Perform a tile-level GEMM on the shared buffers
                # Currently we dispatch to the cute/hip on Nvidia/AMD GPUs
                T.gemm(A_shared, B_shared, C_local)

            # relu
            for i, j in T.Parallel(block_M, block_N):
                C_local[i, j] = T.max(C_local[i, j], 0)

            # Copy result back to global memory
            T.copy(C_local, C[by * block_M, bx * block_N])

    return matmul_relu_kernel


M = 1024  # M = T.dynamic("m") if you want to use dynamic shape
N = 1024
K = 1024
block_M = 128
block_N = 128
block_K = 32

# 1. Define the kernel (matmul) and compile/lower it into an executable module
matmul_relu_kernel = matmul(M, N, K, block_M, block_N, block_K)

# 3. Test the kernel in Python with PyTorch data
import torch

# Create random input tensors on the GPU
a = torch.randn(M, K, device="cuda", dtype=torch.float16)
b = torch.randn(K, N, device="cuda", dtype=torch.float16)
c = torch.empty(M, N, device="cuda", dtype=torch.float16)

# Run the kernel through the Profiler
matmul_relu_kernel(a, b, c)

print(c)
# Reference multiplication using PyTorch
ref_c = torch.relu(a @ b)

# Validate correctness
torch.testing.assert_close(c, ref_c, rtol=1e-2, atol=1e-2)
print("Kernel output matches PyTorch reference.")

# 4. Retrieve and inspect the generated CUDA source (optional)
# cuda_source = matmul_relu_kernel.get_kernel_source()
# print("Generated CUDA kernel:\n", cuda_source)

# 5.Profile latency with kernel
profiler = matmul_relu_kernel.get_profiler(tensor_supply_type=tilelang.TensorSupplyType.Normal)

latency = profiler.do_bench()

print(f"Latency: {latency} ms")
```

### Dive Deep into TileLang Beyond GEMM

In addition to GEMM, we provide a variety of examples to showcase the versatility and power of TileLang, including:

- [Dequantize GEMM](./examples/dequantize_gemm/): Achieve high-performance dequantization by **fine-grained control over per-thread operations**, with many features now adopted as default behaviors in [BitBLAS](https://github.com/microsoft/BitBLAS), which utilizing magic layout transformation and intrins to accelerate dequantize gemm.
- [FlashAttention](./examples/flash_attention/): Enable cross-operator fusion with simple and intuitive syntax, and we also provide an example of auto tuning.
- [LinearAttention](./examples/linear_attention/): Examples include RetNet and Mamba implementations.
- [Convolution](./examples/convolution/): Implementations of Convolution with IM2Col.
